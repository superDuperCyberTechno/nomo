A dark, no-nonsense colorscheme for Vim.

Why is it called *nomo*?
* Because it uses three colors: The light one, the darker one and the darkest one. **No**thing **mo**re.
* Because I was tired of looking for a proper monochrome colorscheme. **No** **mo**re searching.
* It's a monochrome colorscheme and *nomo* is a spoonerism of *mono*.
* *Alien* is an awesome movie and the spaceship in that movie is called **No**stro**mo**

It has 5 tints: 
* white (default)
* green
* red
* blue
* yellow 

Example: Add the following to your .vimrc to change the tint to green:
`let g:nomo_tint='green'`
