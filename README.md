![nomo.vim](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/superDuperCyberTechno/nomo.vim/master/header.png)

A dark, no-nonsense, monochrome colorscheme for Vim. No underlines, bolds, italics or any other redundant rubbish. Other monochrome colorschemes claim to be monochrome but they always half-ass it with weird screaming warning colors or other fucked up gobbledygook....
nomo.vim aims to fix that consistently, with no compromises.

To be pedantic, nomo.vim isn't 100% monochrome either. - At any point in time it will consist of 2 shades of black/white (the darkest being the background, the lighter being comments, line numbers etc.) and one main, customizable, light color (all the important stuff):
* `white` (default)
* `green`
* `red`
* `blue`
* `yellow`
* `random` (any one of the above)

Example: Add the following to your .vimrc to change the main color to green:
`let g:nomo_color='green'`

**Please note: At this point in time, plugin support is very limited. However, all suggestions are welcome.**

Alright, so why is it called *nomo*?
* Because it uses three colors: The light one, the darker one and the darkest one. **No**thing **mo**re.
* Because it uses regular styled text. **No**thing **mo**re.
* Because I was tired of looking for a proper monochrome colorscheme. **No** **mo**re searching.
* Because It's a monochrome colorscheme and *nomo* is a spoonerism of *mono*.
* Because *Alien* is an awesome movie and the spaceship in that movie is called **No**stro**mo**.
